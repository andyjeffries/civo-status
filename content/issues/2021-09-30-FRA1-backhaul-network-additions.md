Maintenance Window 30 September 2021 23:00 CET - 1 October 2021 01:00 CET

We are carrying out works to bring on the Lumen carrier network to add to the backhaul in the FRA1 region. This maintenance window is scheduled for 2 hours from 23:00 CET (GMT+2) 30 September 2021.

This work is expected to be low-risk but short interruptions in connectivity may occur during the window.

The BGP sessions are now up and routes have been exchanged. No customer traffic has been impacted. We are now monitoring the situation. If all is well, no further changes will be made and the next update will close the maintenance.
