We are seeing issues with the main Civo API which means that account pages and API calls (including Civo CLI) may be unresponsive or inaccessible.

We will update here when we know more.

The intermittent issues reaching the Civo API have been resolved and access to customer resources through the web, CLI and API should work as normal.
