We applied a bug fix deployment that has resolved the issue, which was affecting storage subsystems in NYC1. We are continuing to monitor the status of the cluster, but for now the issue is resolved.

We are aware of an issue affecting some running clusters in NYC1. These clusters may experience degraded connectivity. We are investigating the cause and will update here when we know more.

Creation of new clusters should not be impacted but their connectivity may be disrupted.
