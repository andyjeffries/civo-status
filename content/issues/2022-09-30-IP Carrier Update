We are committed to providing resilient and secure networking to back our cloud services. As part of this effort, one of our IP Carriers will be performing scheduled maintanence to upgrade the software on the platform. This is set to take place between 04:00:00 GMT until 07:00:00 GMT on Friday September 30th, 2022. This will take the form of an at-risk window.

We do not expect this work to cause any customer interruptions, however, customers should be aware that during the window we will be operating with reduced network resilience.
