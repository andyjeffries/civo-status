A subset of nodes has developed an issue again and we are working to bring these online.

---

18:29 GMT

All stopped VMs and Kubernetes nodes are back online and the service appears stable.

---

18:25:00 GMT

We are monitoring the stability as the last of the stopped services are being brought back online.

---

17:56:00 GMT

We have restored service to half of the affected instances and cluster nodes and are continuing to work on restoring service to the rest.

We are noticing stoppages across a subset of virtual machines running in the LON1 region. We are working to restore these now. The vast majority of LON1 workloads remain unaffected (and other regions are unaffected).
