The cause of the site outage has been identified as a failure to the resilient UPS systems and is still being mitigated. Engineers are on site and are progressing through the process of ensuring that power can be restored to the site without causing any subsequent interruptions.

At the moment we don't have an ETA for the final power restoration and will be continuing to provide regular updates here.

The next update will be at 02:15 UTC

We hope to have an update on the work progress soon. At the latest, we hope to update at 00:45 UTC (in half an hour) if not sooner.

The power issue continues to persist and we have no indication of an estimated time to fix and restoration of service in the data center that houses the NYC1 region.

We will next update here at 01:15 UTC unless we hear any updates sooner.

We're afraid we have no update to share other than the data center provider in NYC1 is working on restoring power, which continues to be out.

The data center provider work to restore power continues.

We will next update at 00:15:00 UTC failing any other update from the NYC1 data center.

We are in contact with the data center who confirm that they are experiencing wide-ranging power issues. They are attempting to restore the power. 

We will update here next at 23:45.

The power in the NYC1 data center is still out and the region is inaccessible.

We will next update here at 23:15 UTC, or earlier if we can.

The power issue in the data center has reoccurred minutes after the recovery of the workloads. We are working with the data center to recover as soon as possible, along with ensuring that this does not reoccur.

An unexpected site power issue has caused a reboot of a subset of nodes and the routing gear in NYC1.
The region power interruption was partial, and the machines all have powered on. Workloads are starting up now.
