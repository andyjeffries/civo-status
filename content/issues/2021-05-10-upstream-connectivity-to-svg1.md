We are seeing inbound network traffic issues for our SVG1 region which we are investigating. This is due to an issue with the upstream network provider to the SVG1 data centre.
LON1 and NYC1 remain unaffected.

Upstream connectivity has been restored and SVG1 resources should all be accessible again. We will continue to monitor the situation with our upstream networking provider.
