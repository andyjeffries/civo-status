 Due to an uplink switch in NYC1 not responding to management properly, we will reboot it during a maintenance window starting at 09:00 GMT 27 January (04:00 ET 27 January 2022). While we do not expect there to be customer connectivity breaks as a result of this work, there is a risk of a short interruption of a few minutes.
