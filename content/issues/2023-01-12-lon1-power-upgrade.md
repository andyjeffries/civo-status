We are committed to providing resilient and secure facilities to back our cloud services. As part of this effort, we will be performing scheduled maintenance to power hardware in LON1. This is set to take place between 22:00:00 GMT on Thursday January the 12th until 00:00:00 GMT on Friday January the 13th 2022. This will take the form of an at-risk window.

We do not expect this work to cause any customer interruptions, however, customers should be aware that during the window we will be operating with reduced resilience for the duration of the window.
