19:10 UTC

The entire data center power remains off. We are still waiting on the update from the meeting by site management, the fire marshal and electrical contractors. We will update here at 20:00 UTC or earlier if we get an update.

---

16:05 UTC

The latest update we have received from the data center management:

The cleaning for the UPS room is still on going and progressing well. This is due to be completed in time for a site inspecting by the local fire services at 2PM EDT (18:00 UTC).

The data center management expect that the site will pass the requirements to start the powering-on of the site after this inspection.

We will update hear once we hear the results of the meeting and expect the next update by 19:00 UTC

13:28 UTC

The latest update we have received from the data center management:

The process to prepare the UPS room for re-powering the facility after the fire suppression has been on-going through the night, but continues. This is expected to take at least another 3 hours.

Once complete, local regulations require the approval of the fire marshal to begin the next stage in powering up the data center.

We will update here in 3 hours, or sooner if we have any more information.

---

12:00 UTC

The data center operator was due to provide an update at 8:00am EDT, but we have not yet received anything from them.

As soon as we have an update we will post it immediately.

---

03:27 UTC

We have received a new update from the data center management:

The fire marshal procedures require UPS facilities to be cleaned before the data center can be re-powered. This work has begun but they estimate the process will take several hours before any steps to bringing facilities back online.

The data center management expects to issue another update at 8am EDT (12:00 UTC) but we will of course update here if we learn anything before then.

---

02:45 UTC

We have not received an update about the rate of progress, but understand that works are ongoing.

We will next update at 03:45 UTC.

---

02:15 UTC

We have received a futher update from the data center:

An isolated fire in a single UPS in a dedicated electrical room was detected and put out by the automated fire suppression system. The local fire department were called and when they arrived on the scene, and per NEC guidelines, cut the power to the building.

Datacenter electricians are on site and awaiting permission from the fire department to gain access to the building to perform any repair works to the UPS systems and restoring main power to the building.

Once the electrical work is complete, the HVACs will be started to cool the facility. Once temperatures are within the required SLAs, a phased power on will be carried out to data halls.

We do not have an ETA for this process to be completed.

Our next update here will be at 03:15 UTC.

---

01:45:00 UTC

We have received an update from the data center operator: 

The cause of the site outage has been identified as a failure to the resilient UPS systems and is still being mitigated. Engineers are on site and are progressing through the process of ensuring that power can be restored to the site without causing any subsequent interruptions.

At the moment we don't have an ETA for the final power restoration and will be continuing to provide regular updates here.

The next update will be at 02:15 UTC

---

01:15:00 UTC

We hope to have an update on the work progress soon. At the latest, we hope to update at 00:45 UTC (in half an hour) if not sooner.

---

00:45:00 UTC

The power issue continues to persist and we have no indication of an estimated time to fix and restoration of service in the data center that houses the NYC1 region.

We will next update here at 01:15 UTC unless we hear any updates sooner.

---

2023-07-11 00:15:00 UTC

We're afraid we have no update to share other than the data center provider in NYC1 is working on restoring power, which continues to be out.

---

23:45:00 UTC

The data center provider work to restore power continues.

We will next update at 00:15:00 UTC failing any other update from the NYC1 data center.

---

23:15:00 UTC

We are in contact with the data center who confirm that they are experiencing wide-ranging power issues. They are attempting to restore the power. 

We will update here next at 23:45.

---

22:53:00 UTC

The power in the NYC1 data center is still out and the region is inaccessible.

We will next update here at 23:15 UTC, or earlier if we can.

---

2023-07-10 22:34:00 UTC

The power issue in the data center has reoccurred minutes after the recovery of the workloads. We are working with the data center to recover as soon as possible, along with ensuring that this does not reoccur.

---
2023-07-10 22:13:00 UTC

An unexpected site power issue has caused a reboot of a subset of nodes and the routing gear in NYC1.
The region power interruption was partial, and the machines all have powered on. Workloads are starting up now.
