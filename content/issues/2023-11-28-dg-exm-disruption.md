The issues affecting customer VMs in the region have been resolved. We will continue to monitor and will update if required.

We are continuing to see an issue with only one remaining set of VM instances, which may be unrelated to the disruptions experienced more widely. We are working on mitigating the issue for that subset as well.

We are continuing work to restore a small number of affected VM instances in the region. New launches should work as normal, and any VMs not disrupted should continue to run without issue.

Workloads are being brought back online, though some compute nodes remain affected.

We are aware of stopped virtual machines in the Deep Green Exmouth Region (DG-EXM) and are working to mitigate.
