We believe we have identified the issue that is causing API timeouts and slow instance builds, and are working on mitigating it and restoring access.

We are aware of an issue with FRA1 which is causing timeouts and access errors through the Civo API, CLI and website. It is also affecting instance/cluster builds in that region.

We are investigating the cause and will update here when we know more.

Other regions and existing workloads continue to operate normally.
