We would like to inform you about an upcoming period of planned maintenance that will be conducted on our storage infrastructure across multiple regions.

This maintenance is essential to enhance the stability of our services and implement changes to ensure future maintenance can be performed seamlessly, without any service interruptions. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding and patience.

Maintenance Schedule for NYC1: 13th-19th July, and 20th-23rd, 27th-30th July 2023

Maintenance Days: Thursday to Sunday

Maintenance Time: 00:00 to 8:00 (EST)

During the maintenance period, our team will be working to implement fixes and improvements to our storage infrastructure. 

We anticipate that up to 10% of instances in the respective region may be impacted by this maintenance per night. We will take every precaution to ensure the impact will be minimal.

For the affected instances, a short outage will occur as they are halted and subsequently restarted. This interruption will be temporary, and the instances will quickly return to their running state once restarted. As the maintenance progresses, the risk of instances being halted will decrease, further minimising any potential disruptions.

If you have any concerns or questions regarding this maintenance period, please don't hesitate to contact us.
