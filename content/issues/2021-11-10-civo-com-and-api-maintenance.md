The new API is live, and should be all working for everyone again. Please feel to reach out to the support team on our Community Slack if you notice any issues. Thanks for your patience.

We are putting live a new API service that should offer faster performance and better Terraform reliability. Civo.com and pages under it may appear unreachable during this deployment. We are working on getting this completed as soon as possible.

Existing customer workloads will continue to operate as normal.
