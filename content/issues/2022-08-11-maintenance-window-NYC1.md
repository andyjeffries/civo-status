Civo are committed to providing resilient and secure networking to back their cloud services. As part of this effort, our engineering team will be performing essential software updates to the Internet routing platform in the NYC1 region until 12:00:00 GMT. This will take the form of an at-risk window, during which we will be upgrading router software and making changes to peer connections to tier-1 network partners.
We do not expect this work to cause any customer interruptions, however, customers should be aware that during the window we will be operating with reduced network resilience.
