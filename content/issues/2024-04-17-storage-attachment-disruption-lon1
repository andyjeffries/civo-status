We are aware of a disruption in storage attachments in the LON1 region. Mounting volumes to existing virtual machine instances and nodes will not currently complete successfully. This is also impacting launches of new VM instances/Kubernetes nodes as they require a volume attachment to come online.

Existing workloads in the region continue to operate as normal. Restarting virtual machine instances or Kubernetes nodes will cause them to be affected.

We will update here when we have more details.
