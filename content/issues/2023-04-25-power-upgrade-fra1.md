We are committed to providing resilient and secure facilities to back our cloud services. As part of this effort, we will be performing scheduled maintenance to power hardware in FRA1. This is set to take place between 21:00:00 GMT (22:00 Frankfurt time) on Tuesday April the 25th until 00:00:00 GMT (01:00 Frankfurt time) on Wednesday April the 26th 2023. This will take the form of an at-risk window.

We do not expect this work to cause any customer interruptions, however, customers should be aware that during the window we will be operating with reduced resilience for the duration of the window (3 hours).
