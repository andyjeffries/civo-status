On Thursday the 8th of July at 6am GMT+1 (1am ET, 10pm PT July 4th), there will be a planned outage of Civo region LON1. We anticipate an at-risk window of up to three hours of unavailability for this region. 

This is to facilitate work to upgrade the data storage layer in use across our clusters, which will also enable non-disruptive updates in future. Whilst we apologise for the disruption, this is a vital upgrade that will enable faster and more efficient provisioning of volumes for Civo Kubernetes clusters and Infrastructure-as-a-Service Instances.

Users with active services on LON1 will see connectivity restored as soon as the upgrade window is complete.
