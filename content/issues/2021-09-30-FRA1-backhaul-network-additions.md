Maintenance Window 30 September 2021 23:00 CET - 1 October 2021 01:00 CET

We are carrying out works to bring on the Lumen carrier network to add to the backhaul in the FRA1 region. This maintenance window is scheduled for 2 hours from 23:00 CET (GMT+2) 30 September 2021.

This work is expected to be low-risk but short interruptions in connectivity may occur during the window.
