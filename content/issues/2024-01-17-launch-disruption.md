We apologize for the inconvenience of not being able to launch clusters or instances from the dashboard, and are working on deploying a fix.

The Civo website is currently experencing disruption with instance and cluster launches, with the page giving an error on viewing both the cluster and instance creation page.

The API and CLI remain functional, and we are working on restoring the page to functionality.
