16:57 UTC

We have received an update from the data center operator.

They have completed the full site inspection with the fire marshal and the electrical inspector and utility power has been restored to the site.

They are now working to restore critical systems with the primary electrical equipment for the site powered up. Concurrently, they are beginning work to bring the mechanical plant online. Additional engineers from other facilities are on site this morning to expedite site turn up.

They plan on data halls, and customer equipment, including Civo's, to be powered up in the late afternoon EDT (evening UTC).

We will look to update here by 21:00 UTC with details.

15:55 UTC

We have received the following update from the data center operator:

---

Our site inspection this morning went well and we have been granted authorization to restore utility power to the site and are currently working on re-energizing utility power to the facility. Our onsite team is working with the fire marshal and electrical inspectors, ensuring electrical system safety as we prepare to bring utility power back to the site.

Once that is completed, we will work towards bringing up our critical infrastructure systems. This will take approximately 5 hours.

While we are working on that, we will also be working on our fire/life safety systems as we need to replace some smoke detectors and have a full inspection of the fire system prior to allowing customers to enter the facility.

We will be sending out hourly updates as we make progress on bringing the facility back online.

---

We will be updating here with everything we learn from these hourly updates.

---

2023-07-12 14:30 UTC

We have received the latest update from the data center operator:

Works have continued overnight and an inspection meeting is underway to assess the authorization and process of re-powering the facility.


As this meeting is currently under way, we have not had a report back from the data center as to timelines. We will be sure to update here as soon as we do.

---

20:50 UTC

We have had a further update from the data center:

---
We have just finished the meeting with the fire marshal, electrical inspectors, and our onsite management. They have asked us to clean additional spaces and  have also asked us to replace some components of the fire system. They have set a time to come back and review these requests at 9am EDT (13:00UTC) Wednesday. We are working to comply completely with these new requests with these vendors and are bringing in additional cleaning personnel onsite to make the fire marshal's deadline.

In preparation for being able to allow clients onsite, the fire marshal has stated that we need to perform a full test of the fire/life safety systems which will be done after utility power has been restored and fire system components replaced. We have these vendors standing by for this work tomorrow.
Assuming that all goes as planned, the earliest that power would be restored to servers would be late in the day Wednesday.

---

We at Civo appreciate the frustrations this prolonged outage is causing our customers. The priority of the fire department is to make the site safe before bringing it back online, so we are unable to escalate this, as the fire marshal's decision is final.

We're also not able to access our equipment at this time, so are unable to attempt to move it to another data center. The site is locked down by the fire department.

Once the issue is fully resolved, we'll be pushing the data center for extensive information on exactly what happened and will be seeking assurances for the future.

We will follow up with status updates here as we get more information from the data center. Our next update will be at 14:30UTC Wednesday 12th at the earliest, allowing time for the data center and the fire department to carry out their inspections at 13:30 and report back to us.

---

19:10 UTC

The entire data center power remains off. We are still waiting on the update from the meeting by the data center operator, the fire marshal and electrical contractors. We will update here at 20:00 UTC or earlier if we get an update.

---

16:05 UTC

The latest update we have received from the data center operator:

The cleaning for the UPS room is still on going and progressing well. This is due to be completed in time for a site inspecting by the local fire services at 2PM EDT (18:00 UTC).

The data center operator expects that the site will pass the requirements to start the powering-on of the site after this inspection.

We will update hear once we hear the results of the meeting and expect the next update by 19:00 UTC

---

13:28 UTC

The latest update we have received from the data center operator:

The process to prepare the UPS room for re-powering the facility after the fire suppression has been on-going through the night, but continues. This is expected to take at least another 3 hours.

Once complete, local regulations require the approval of the fire marshal to begin the next stage in powering up the data center.

We will update here in 3 hours, or sooner if we have any more information.

---

12:00 UTC

The data center operator was due to provide an update at 8:00am EDT, but we have not yet received anything from them.

As soon as we have an update we will post it immediately.

---

03:27 UTC

We have received a new update from the data center operator:

The fire marshal procedures require UPS facilities to be cleaned before the data center can be re-powered. This work has begun but they estimate the process will take several hours before any steps to bringing facilities back online.

The data center operator expects to issue another update at 8am EDT (12:00 UTC) but we will of course update here if we learn anything before then.

---

02:45 UTC

We have not received an update about the rate of progress, but understand that works are ongoing.

We will next update at 03:45 UTC.

---

02:15 UTC

We have received a futher update from the data center:

An isolated fire in a single UPS in a dedicated electrical room was detected and put out by the automated fire suppression system. The local fire department were called and when they arrived on the scene, and per NEC guidelines, cut the power to the building.

Datacenter electricians are on site and awaiting permission from the fire department to gain access to the building to perform any repair works to the UPS systems and restoring main power to the building.

Once the electrical work is complete, the HVACs will be started to cool the facility. Once temperatures are within the required SLAs, a phased power on will be carried out to data halls.

We do not have an ETA for this process to be completed.

Our next update here will be at 03:15 UTC.

---

01:45:00 UTC

We have received an update from the data center operator: 

The cause of the site outage has been identified as a failure to the resilient UPS systems and is still being mitigated. Engineers are on site and are progressing through the process of ensuring that power can be restored to the site without causing any subsequent interruptions.

At the moment we don't have an ETA for the final power restoration and will be continuing to provide regular updates here.

The next update will be at 02:15 UTC

---

01:15:00 UTC

We hope to have an update on the work progress soon. At the latest, we hope to update at 00:45 UTC (in half an hour) if not sooner.

---

00:45:00 UTC

The power issue continues to persist and we have no indication of an estimated time to fix and restoration of service in the data center that houses the NYC1 region.

We will next update here at 01:15 UTC unless we hear any updates sooner.

---

2023-07-11 00:15:00 UTC

We're afraid we have no update to share other than the data center provider in NYC1 is working on restoring power, which continues to be out.

---

23:45:00 UTC

The data center provider work to restore power continues.

We will next update at 00:15:00 UTC failing any other update from the NYC1 data center.

---

23:15:00 UTC

We are in contact with the data center who confirm that they are experiencing wide-ranging power issues. They are attempting to restore the power. 

We will update here next at 23:45.

---

22:53:00 UTC

The power in the NYC1 data center is still out and the region is inaccessible.

We will next update here at 23:15 UTC, or earlier if we can.

---

2023-07-10 22:34:00 UTC

The power issue in the data center has reoccurred minutes after the recovery of the workloads. We are working with the data center to recover as soon as possible, along with ensuring that this does not reoccur.

---
2023-07-10 22:13:00 UTC

An unexpected site power issue has caused a reboot of a subset of nodes and the routing gear in NYC1.
The region power interruption was partial, and the machines all have powered on. Workloads are starting up now.
