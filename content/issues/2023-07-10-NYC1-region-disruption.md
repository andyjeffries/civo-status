The power issue in the data center has reoccurred minutes after the recovery of the workloads. We are working with the data center to recover as soon as possible, along with ensuring that this does not reoccur.

An unexpected site power issue has caused a reboot of a subset of nodes and the routing gear in NYC1.
The region power interruption was partial, and the machines all have powered on. Workloads are starting up now.
