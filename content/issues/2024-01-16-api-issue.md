We have rolled out a fix and are monitoring the API for stability. For now access should be restored.

We believe the pods are crashing due to a change that was rolled out earlier in the day. We are investigating a fix while we roll back.

All workloads that run on Civo regions continue unaffected. The issue that we are seeing is confined to the Kubernetes pods running the Civo API.

We are seeing intermittent issues with the Civo API not responding, causing timeouts and errors both in API query responses as well as the Civo website on pages that relies on the API. We are investigating.
