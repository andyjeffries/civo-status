We are committed to providing resilient and secure networking to back our cloud services. As part of this effort, our engineering team will be performing an upgrade on a core router in the NYC1 region. This is set to take place between 08:00:00 GMT until 10:00:00 GMT (04:00 ET until 06:00 ET) on Tuesday September 27th, 2022. This will take the form of an at-risk window.

We do not expect this work to cause any customer interruptions, however, customers should be aware that during the window we will be operating with reduced network resilience.
