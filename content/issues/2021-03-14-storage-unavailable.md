We've been working with our storage partner to implement some Kernel tweaking which has resolved the issue. Some nodes may be in a strange state and we're working through fixing those, but launches should work as normal again now. Thanks for your patience.

We've been made aware of an issue with our storage in NYC1. We're working on investigating this with our storage partner
at the moment.

This won't affect currently running clusters and nodes; but it will stop new cluster launches, node recycling and
cluster scaling up.

We'll update again when we get further updates.
