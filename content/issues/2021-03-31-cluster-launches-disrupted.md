Weâ€™re seeing an issue with new clusters not starting `Traefik` and `metrics-server` even when not requested to be removed from new clusters. 

We are updating an operator to fix this issue.
If you are seeing a cluster that is not responding correctly, we advise to delete it and start a new cluster once this issue is marked resolved.

Existing workloads are running, and will continue to do so.
