The team is investigating the root cause of the disruption and is working to bring any halted workloads back online.

A subset of cloud resources (Kubernetes clusters, instances, etc) may be inaccessible in NYC1 at the moment and we are investigating the cause.
Most workloads in the NYC1 region remain unaffected and respond as normal. New resource launches should not be seeing issues.
