Resource creation in LON1 should no longer be an issue. If any instances or other resources remain pending in your account, please don't hesitate to contact us.

We are aware of issues scheduling new workloads and volumes in LON1 and are working on a fix. While we work on this, new instances, Kubernetes nodes, scale-ups of node pools, etc may be disrupted.
